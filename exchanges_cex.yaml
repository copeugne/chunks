      trades, your assets - even in the event of a bankruptcy or insolvency.

    description: |
      The Maiar Decentralized Exchange (DEX) is the Automated Market Maker (AMM), rearchitecting some of the key elements to
      build a product that can leverage the entire performance of the Elrond architecture, to offer global, near-instant,
      inexpensive transactions among an expanding suite of assets. The essence of current versions of automated market makers
      is best expressed through the constant product equation: x * y = k Based on it, if a swap pool owns some units of token
      x and some units of token y, it prices trades so that the quantities of x and y resulting after the trade, when
      multiplied, are equal to a fixed constant, k. But current AMM performance could be significantly improved by rebuilding
      them on vastly more scalable architectures. By reimagining an automated market maker on top of a highly scalable
      architecture that is high bandwidth, low latency, and inexpensive, the performance of the swap processes can be
      drastically improved. With significantly better performance, the scope of AMMs can be rapidly expanded, giving birth to
      new mark
